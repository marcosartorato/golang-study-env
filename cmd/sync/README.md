# Go `sync` Package

The [`sync`](https://pkg.go.dev/sync) package provides basic synchronization primitives for concurrent programming in Go.

## Common Types

- **`sync.Mutex`**: Mutual exclusion lock for safe access to shared data.
- **`sync.WaitGroup`**: Waits for a group of goroutines to finish.
- **`sync.Once`**: Ensures a function is only executed once.
- **`sync.RWMutex`**: Like `Mutex`, but allows multiple readers or one writer.

See the code examples in this folder for practical usage.
