# golang-study-env

This repository contains small, self-contained examples showing how to use different Go packages.  
Each package has its own folder with a `main.go` file that demonstrates key functionality.

## Package Examples

- [sync](./cmd/sync/README.md): Synchronization primitives for concurrent programming in Go.
- [sync/atomic](./cmd/sync-atomic/README.md): Low-level atomic memory primitives for safe concurrent programming.
- [context](./cmd/context/README.md): Deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes.
- [net/http](./cmd/net-http/README.md): HTTP client and server implementation.
